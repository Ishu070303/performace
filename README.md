# Website Performance Analysis Report
**Site:** https://www.gripinvest.in/  
**Analysis Date:** September 24, 2025  
**Analysis Tools:** Chrome DevTools Core Web Vitals, Google Lighthouse, Strapi API Performance Analysis

## Performance Analysis Methodology

### Comprehensive Testing Approach
* **Frontend Performance:** Lighthouse audit (mobile view) for Core Web Vitals
* **API Performance:** Detailed analysis of Strapi & REST API calls on homepage load
* **Response Time Measurement:** Individual API call timing and redundancy checks
* **Production Environment:** Real-world performance data from live users
* **Cross-reference Analysis:** Comparing API delays with LCP timing impact
Our website has **critical performance issues** that are directly impacting user experience and potentially affecting conversion rates. While our technical foundation is solid, we have one major bottleneck causing 3-second load times - well above industry standards.

## Current Performance Status

### Core Web Vitals Analysis (Real User Data)
| Metric | Our Production | Industry Standard | Status | Impact |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|---------|---------|
| **LCP (Loading Speed)** | 2.97s | <2.5s | ❌ **FAILING** | Users wait 3s to see content |
| **CLS (Visual Stability)** | 0 | <0.1 | ✅ **PERFECT** | No layout jumping |
| **INP (Responsiveness)** | 160ms | <200ms | ✅ **GOOD** | Fast interactions |

### Lighthouse Audit Scores
| Category | Score | Status | Business Impact |
|----------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **Performance** | 3/4 | ❌ **POOR** | Slow loading affects conversions |
| **Accessibility** | 21/24 | ⚠️ **NEEDS WORK** | Excludes users with disabilities |
| **Best Practices** | 6/6 | ✅ **EXCELLENT** | Strong technical foundation |
| **SEO** | 6/6 | ✅ **EXCELLENT** | Search engines rank us well |

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Oversized Image Assets
**Technical Finding:** Images are significantly larger than their displayed dimensions
- **Symptoms:** Slow Largest Contentful Paint (2.97s vs 2.5s target)
- **Impact:** Unnecessary bandwidth consumption, extended load times
- **Scope:** Affects hero images and primary content images across the site

### Secondary Issue: API Performance & Redundancy
**Technical Finding:** Homepage makes 4 API calls with redundant requests identified

#### API Call Performance Breakdown:
| API Endpoint | Response Time | Status |
|--------------|---------------|---------|
| `/liquidity` | 0.037s | ✅ **Fast** |
| `/assets/homepage` | 0.046s | ✅ **Good** |
| `/inner-pages-data` | 0.066s | ⚠️ **Acceptable** |
| `/experiments-data` | 0.068s | ⚠️ **Acceptable** |

**Critical Finding:** Redundant API calls detected on first homepage load:
- `/mobile-banner` - **Called twice**
- `/liquidity` - **Called twice**

**Impact Assessment:**
- Individual API response times are reasonable (37-68ms)
- **Redundancy issue** may contribute to LCP delay
- **Total API load time** could be optimized by eliminating duplicate calls

### Tertiary Issues: Accessibility Gaps
1. **Color Contrast Problems:** Text difficult to read against backgrounds
2. **Missing Language Declaration:** Screen readers cannot identify page language
3. **Improper Heading Structure:** Navigation issues for assistive technologies


## What's Working Well
- **Zero layout shifts** - Users don't experience content jumping around while loading
- **Fast interactions** - Buttons, forms, and UI elements respond quickly (160ms)
- **Perfect SEO setup** - Search engines can crawl and index our content effectively
- **Strong technical foundation** - Following modern web development best practices
- **Excellent code quality** - No major technical debt or security issues

## Technical Complexity Assessment
- **Root cause is straightforward:** Image optimization issue, not architectural problems
- **Solution complexity:** Medium - requires asset optimization and responsive image implementation
- **Risk level:** Low - Standard web optimization practices
- **Technical debt:** Minimal - this is an enhancement, not a fix for broken functionality

## Success Metrics & Goals
- **Primary target:** LCP < 2.5s (currently 2.97s)
- **Secondary target:** Lighthouse Performance score 4/4 (currently 3/4)
- **Accessibility target:** Full compliance 24/24 (currently 21/24)
- **Monitoring:** Continuous Core Web Vitals tracking
